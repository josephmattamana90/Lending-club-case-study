## General Information
- We have a loan dataset which contains information about past loan applicants and whether they defaulted or not. Identification of risky loan applicants using exploratory data analysis is the aim of this case study and hence will cut down the amount of credit loss. 
- First step involves loading the dataset in python pandas library. Then the data has been cleaned by identifying missing values. Some columns which seem to be not necessary have been removed for analysis. Data of some columns have been manipulated for analysis. Then univariate and bivariate analysis has been done to draw conculsions.



## Conclusions
- The following are the risky groups:
   - Groups E,F,G.
   - Walmart employees.
   - Applicants of 891 and 925 zipcodes have highest charged off rate.
   - Applicants with dti 17 have more chance of charged off loans
   - Most of the applicants of charged off loans have annual income in the range 21000 to 80000 and dti more than 14.
   - Interest rate is observed to be more than 11% for charged off loans.


## Technologies Used
- Pandas - Version 1.5.3
- Matplotlib - Version 3.7.1
